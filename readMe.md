**PrintSaver**

Is an open source multi-platform gcode analyzer that allows to cut gcode to allow a 3d printer to continue job from a selected layer.

We all bean there a multi-hour prints file beacons a nozel cloged, and we see it too late to stop it and save on the spot. To recover it, we need to measurer the height of the field print and cut gcode to size. I diced to simplify this process and create a simple software to do it.

Finally, I would love the software to allow remover parts of a multi-element print.
